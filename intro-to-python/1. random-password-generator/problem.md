# Random Password Generator

You are required to build a Random Password Generator using Python that helps users create strong and customizable passwords.

The program should allow the user to specify the desired password length, with a default value of 20 characters if no input is provided.

Additionally, the user should be prompted to choose whether they want to include uppercase letters, numbers, and special symbols in the password. These options should be confirmed through simple Yes/No inputs.

Based on the selected criteria, the program should generate a password by randomly selecting characters from the relevant character sets (e.g., lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, symbols).

The final password should be printed on the screen. The program must also handle invalid inputs gracefully and ensure that at least one type of character is selected to generate a valid password.
